An experimental view of `Bugzilla`_ where time is immutable. This is an idea
borrowed from `Scrum/Agile`_: you can move milestones all you want but you
can't move time! If you release once a week then it's useful to see what you
can actually release next week, the week after, and two months after that.

When you start to remove unimportant features from your team's workload you'll
notice that you will magically release the important features faster :)
